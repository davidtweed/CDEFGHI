CDEFGHI
=======

A sub-language for creating array processing in a compilable format.

The project title is a backcronym standing for "Compiled Data Extraction, Fusion-Graph Hot Interface". (The plan is for this not to have its own identity long enough to make needing a cool title, so I've just gone for easy to remember.)

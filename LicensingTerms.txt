This code is under unusual conditions at the moment. Because I
deliberately don't want to design, create and popularise a whole new
language with all capabilities, the ultimate goal is to make this
either a formal part of, or a "package" that works exceptionally well
with a language with a wider scope (for example Julia). This language
will definitely be in the Libre/OpenSource realm, but precisely which
licence is used is not a vital matter in my plans for this code. Certainly to
be incorporated into a bigger language the licence will have to be
compatible with the larger body of code, and ideally would be
identical with it (if only to avoid having to answer questions about
how/why the licence differs). As such, at the moment the code is
released under the MIT licence, but I reserve the right to re-licence
future versions under a different licence (until it has a definite
"home", at which point the licence will be announced as fixed).

I'm very interested in contributions, but contributors should only do
so, until the licence is fixed, on the agreement that their
contributions may be relicenced (eg, GPL version X). It would be very
helpful if contributors would informally make it clear that they agree
to this when sending patches or issuing any pull requests.
